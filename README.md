# Option<CSharp>
I felt like bringing Rust's Option type over to C# as much as the language would allow

Features / todos:
- [x] is_x
- [x] unwrap_x variants, expect
- [ ] map_x
- [ ] inspect
- [ ] Result (!)
  - [ ] ok_x n such :)
  - [ ] transpose
- [ ] iter :)
  - [ ] get, insert, replace
  - [ ] take, zip, unzip
  - [ ] to/from iter
- [ ] boolean algebraic functions (and/or/etc)
- [ ] maybe: ref/deref shenanigans
- [ ] flatten
- [ ] fancier type compatibility?
